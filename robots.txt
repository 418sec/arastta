# If the Arastta store is installed within a folder such as at
# e.g. www.example.com/arastta/ the robots.txt file MUST be
# moved to the store root at e.g. www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the arastta folder name MUST be prefixed to the disallowed
# path, e.g. the Disallow rule for the /admin/ folder
# MUST be changed to read Disallow: /arastta/admin/
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html

# For syntax checking, see:
